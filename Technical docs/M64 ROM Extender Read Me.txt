Super Mario 64 ROM Extender 1.1b  ----- 2006 VL-Tone starxon@gmail.com

Thanks to BGNG for providing the MIO0 decoder and byte swapper external commands.

This program is used to make an editable version of Super Mario 64, to be used with my level
editor, which should be released later this year. It's a beta, use at your own risks.

Please don't mind the BinaryIO demo dialog that appear when you start the program, just click OK to continue.

You don't have to pay or register anything to use this program.

It's released for testing purposes, and while it's built to be eventually used in the editor,
it can be very usefull to anyone wanting to edit textures, as some programs already can view
and edit the n64 texture format. (You'll have to find the texture offsets and sizes for now,
but I'll provide a list soon.). With the extended ROM, you don't have to worry about
compression size anymore, you can just save changes and open the ROM in an editor.

What this program will do:

1. Swap bytes if a .v64 version is provided. The output file is in .z64 format (ABCD byte
order)
2. Extend the ROM to 24 megs, by adding 16 megs of "FF".
3. Decompress all the MIO0 files in a directory named "MIO0files".
4. Copy the uncompressed data in the upper 16 megs of the extended ROM, leaving 32k gaps
between data segments.
5. Change pointers to match the decompressed data.
6. Recalculate the checksums.

What this program won't do.

1. It doesn't work with European and Japanese versions.
3. It won't work with ROMs that have a byte ordering other than ABCD or BADC.
3. It doesn't make Luigi a playable character.
4. The extended ROM won't run on an iPod.

Some other little things to note:

A few segments are copied with a MIO0 header, but those are editable, just take the header
into account. These appear to be valid MIO0 data to the game, but actually contains only
un-compressed data.

A 32k gap is left between each segment, for possible extension. There is a lot of space left
at the end of the ROM, because it has to be bigger than 16 megs, and the size has to be either
8,16,24 or 32 megs.

Here is a list of which MIO0 files are copied where, and if they include a MIO0 header.

If you need this list in a more "computer friendly" format, just ask me.
